# picpi

Python application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi for use as a digital photo frame.  The goal is to produce an easily used picture frame package to be usable without external sources (fbi, etc) with low overhead so it can run on the Raspberry Pi, and not need X to be started.

# Motivation

Created as a Christmas Present to be included with a digital picture frame for family.

# Installation

The script does not need installed.  Running the script from anywhere will suffice.

TL;DR verison:  I don't care what you do with it, but give me attribution.  If this code breaks your stuff, that sucks.  Not my problem.  I wrote this to be publicly available and any use is at your own risk.
